### Visualization 1: Building and Agency Bar Graph

<vegachart schema-url="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/json/viz1.json" style="width: 100%"></vegachart>

#### Visualization 1 Write Up

The bar chart shows the distribution between buildings and agencies. It shows that which 
agencies have the most properties. I sorted the data so that it is more clear to see the 
distribution in counts. Moreover, I did not choose a color to seperate different agency but I used an interactive way for the audience to choose which bar they would like to take a look at, the graph will make the other bar grey so it is easier for the audience to look at a specific bar. There were too many data so I have to include ``` alt.data_transformers.disable_max_rows() ``` to make sure that the code works. I used a different dataset so that there were no overlaping analysis with homeowork 5.

### Visualization 2:

<vegachart schema-url="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/json/viz2.json" style="width: 100%"></vegachart>

#### Visualization 2 Write Up

The scatter plot shows the distribution of square footage of buildings by year constructed. The plot uses different colors to seperate out counties which makes it looks a little bit messy but I want to use color to see the distribution of county. The more color dot there is on the plot means that the more building the county has. There is just simple zoom in and out feature with tooltip that could be used to see a specific data point. I filtered the data that has valid square footage and year constructed. I used a different dataset so that there were no overlaping analysis with homeowork 5.
